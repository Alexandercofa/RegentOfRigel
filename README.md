# RegentOfRigel
Regent of Rigel is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript clone of the 1993 game Master of Orion that runs entirely in a browser tab.

Currently this project is not in any kind of playable state, but to try it out simply download the repository and access it through your web browser. For security reasons, your browser will require you run a local web server (I use Python's inbuilt web server using the command `python -m http.server` in the source directory).
